        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
                until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium
                heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about
                5 minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continously. Continue
                to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes,
                making sure the milk doesn't burn.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Drain Macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</p></li>
